    "The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is an evolutionary algorithm (EA) inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural selection which espouses Survival of the fittest. As per the natural selection theory, the fittest individuals are selected to produce offsprings. The fittest parents' characteristics are then passed on to their offsprings using cross-over and mutation to ensure better chances of survival. Genetic algorithms are randomized search algorithms that generate high-quality optimization solutions by imitating the biologically inspired natural selection process such as selection, cross-over, and mutation."
